Crazy girl...

She's like a model
The way she dances
I like her style
I just want to do... things
That's gonna drive her crazy

She's unbelievable
Oh I like her style
When she comes through I
I got a plan to do... things
That's gonna drive her crazy

Crazy girl, crazy girl
You drive me crazy girl, crazy girl
You drive me good... yeah
You driving me crazy girl

You're like a dream
When I wake up
I go back to sleep
Coz in this dream I get to do... things
That's gonna drive you crazy girl

And when I touch you
When I make love to you
I'm going straight for the spot that makes you wanna sing out - ooh... yeah
You're driving me crazy girl

Crazy girl, crazy girl
You drive me crazy girl, crazy girl
You drive me good...
You driving me crazy girl

You drive me crazy cooko lala out my brain I can't decide
What the, it's the Dolce Gabbana jeans on your thighs
Off the Gucci blouse, off Chloe shades on your eyes
Maybe it's the Christian Labutons getting me high
Maybe you is born with it, maybe its Maybeline
Either way girl I'm still recruiting you for my team
I could be your manager put you in magazines
Make you a celebrity overnight, know what I mean

Crazy girl, crazy girl
You drive me crazy girl, crazy girl
You drive me good...
You driving me crazy girl

Crazy girl, crazy girl
You drive me crazy girl, crazy girl
You drive me good...
You driving me crazy girl

Crazy girl...
